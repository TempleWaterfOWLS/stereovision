Optimized and debug versions of examples can be built using the macro BUILD_EXAMPLE defined at command line.
This macro can take two values, default and default.dbg, respectively for optimized and debug versions.

Hereinafter an usage example:

examples$ make BUILD_EXAMPLE=default 

this command will build all examples under examples/common/(convert16image, grabstereo, stereo, ...)

However, optimized version of examples are also built simply by typing 'make' at command line

examples$ make

to copy built examples into the bin folder :

examples$ make BUILD_EXAMPLE=default installbin

to clean built examples :

examples$ make BUILD_EXAMPLE=default clean

to clean bin folder :

examples$ make BUILD_EXAMPLE=default cleanbin

see Makefile for each example for details

Some examples (e.g. grabstereo, etc) depend on flycapture. Download and install Flycapture2 before running or building examples 
(see Point Grey Research support web page). Moreover, these examples require a Bumblebee camera to be connected.

Moreover, some examples (e.g. stereo, customizedstereo, etc) require input arguments. If no arguments are provided, examples will try to run with default arguments.
